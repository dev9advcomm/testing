# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post. This is a simple example of how to use MDX with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a powerful format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. It's perfect for blogs because you can:

- Write content in markdown
- Use React components
- Style with Tailwind CSS

## Adding Images

Here's an example of an image from Unsplash:

## Code Example

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello from MDX!');
}
```

## Styling with Tailwind

You can use Tailwind classes directly in your MDX:

<div className="bg-blue-100 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
  This is a styled div using Tailwind CSS!
</div>

## Conclusion

This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more posts!
